TinyComLog
================

A tiny logger that reads com port communication and can write this to a file.

It allows for both .csv and .txt files.

Visual studio project included in the folder ``ComLogger``. Portable version of the .exe file can be found in ``Binary_portable``.
The code is pretty poorly commented right now but will probably improve in the future. It should not be too hard to decipher what is going on.
